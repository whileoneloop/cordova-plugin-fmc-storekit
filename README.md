# cordova-plugin-fmc-storekit

The purpose of this plugin is to inject an ipestbook storekit configuration resource file into the xcode project.

Bonus points if we can have the plugin select the scheme for use during run only for test/local simulator builds (e.g. looking at an environment variable to know to turn on the scheme option).
