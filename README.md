# cordova-plugin-fmc-storekit

The purpose of this plugin is to inject a Farmanco iPestbook storekit configuration resource file into the xcode project.  This file allows testing IAP when running in xcode / IOS simulator.

Bonus points if we have the plugin select the scheme for use during run only for test/local simulator builds (e.g. looking at an environment variable to know to turn on the scheme option).
